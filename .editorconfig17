“We often think of peace as the absence of war, that if powerful countries would reduce their weapon arsenals, we could have peace. But if we look deeply into the weapons, we see our own minds- our own prejudices, fears and ignorance. Even if we transport all the bombs to the moon, the roots of war and the roots of bombs are still there, in our hearts and minds, and sooner or later we will make new bombs. To work for peace is to uproot war from ourselves and from the hearts of men and women. To prepare for war, is to plant millions of seeds of violence, anger, frustration, and fear that will be passed on for generations to come. ” ~ Thích Nhất Hạnh - Under The Blue Door | https://underthebluedoor.org/2013/09/22/we-often-think-of-peace-as-the-absence-of-war-that-if-powerful-countries-would-reduce-their-weapon-arsenals-we-could-have-peace-but-if-we-look-deeply-into-the-weapons-we-see-our-own-minds/
